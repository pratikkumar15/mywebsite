	abstract = {Enzyme-based self-labeling tags enable covalent attachment of synthetic molecules to proteins inside living cells. A frontier of this field is designing multifunctional ligands that contain both fluorophores and affinity tags or pharmacological agents and can still efficiently enter cells. Self-labeling tag ligands with short linkers can enter cells readily but often show less activity due to steric issues; ligands with long linkers can be more potent but show lower cell permeability. Here, we overcome this tug-of-war between efficacy and cell-permeability by devising a rational strategy for making cell permeable multifunctional ligands for labeling HaloTag fusions. We found that the lactone–zwitterion equilibrium constant (KL–Z) of rhodamines inversely correlates with their distribution coefficients (logD7.4), suggesting that ligands based on dyes exhibiting low KL–Z and high logD7.4 values, such as Si-rhodamines, would efficiently enter cells. We designed cell-permeable multifunctional HaloTag ligands with a biotin moiety to purify mitochondria or a JQ1 appendage to translocate BRD4 from euchromatin to the nucleolus or heterochromatin. We discovered that translocation of BRD4 to constitutive heterochromatin in cells expressing HaloTag–HP1a fusion proteins can lead to apparent increases in transcriptional activity. These new reagents enable affinity capture and translocation of intracellular proteins in living cells and the use of Si-rhodamines and other low KL–Z/high logD7.4 dye scaffolds will facilitate the design of new multifunctional chemical tools for biology.},
