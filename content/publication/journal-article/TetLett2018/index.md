abstract: Lipidated cyclopropenes serve as useful bioorthogonal reagents for imaging cell membranes due to the cyclopropene's small size and ability to ligate with pro-fluorescent tetrazines. Previously, the lipidation of cyclopropenes required modification at the C3 position because methods to append lipids at C1/C2 were not available. Herein, we describe C1/C2 lipidation with the biologically active lipid ceramide and a common phospholipid using a cyclopropene scaffold whose reactivity with 1,2,4,5-tetrazines has been caged.
