&emsp;&emsp;I am an HHMI postdoc with <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/lavis-lab" target="_blank">Luke Lavis</a> (Janelia). I use fluorescent dyes to make reagents for cell biology, neuroscience, Photopharmacology, and imaging.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;During my PhD with <a href="https://www.laughlinlab.com" target="_blank">Scott Laughlin</a>, I made light and enzyme-controlled cyclopropenes for bioorthogonal labeling/imaging in cellular systems. Before coming to the US, as an undergrad, I worked on bactericidal, cationic gemini surfactants with <a href="https://www.jncasr.ac.in/jayanta" target="_blank">Jayanta Haldar</a>.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I strongly care about effective mentoring, diversity in academia, awareness about alternative career options, and communicating my science to public.
