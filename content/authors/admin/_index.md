I am an HHMI postdoc with <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/lavis-lab" target="_blank">Luke Lavis</a> (Janelia) and <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Chemical-Biology-Laboratory/martin-j-schnermann" target="_blank">Martin Schnermann</a> (NCI/NIH). I make new chemigenetic probes, photoactivatable drugs, and fluorescent probes for imaging.
During my PhD with <a href="https://www.laughlinlab.com" target="_blank">Scott Laughlin</a>, I made light and enzyme-controlled cyclopropene-tetrazine bioorthogonal ligations for protein labeling and cellular imaging. Separately, to bring bioorthogonal chemistry to neuroscience, I made cyclopropene analogs of the amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate. I also explored the reversible binding of boronic acids with sugars present on cell-surface to label neural circuits in the olfactory system of larval zebrafish. Before coming to the US, my first research experience was working on bactericidal, cationic gemini surfactants with <a href="https://www.jncasr.ac.in/jayanta" target="_blank">Jayanta Haldar</a>.

I care about effective mentoring, diversity in academia, awareness about alternative career options, and communicating my science to public. During my PhD, I was heavily involved with Graduate Chemical Society, Graduate Student Organization, and Graduate career Association. Along the way, I mentored high school students, undergraduates and graduate students in the lab. Apart from lab, I enjoyed taking courses at the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Sciences. In 2016, I co-started BrainChem in collaboration with <a href="https://anushashankar.weebly.com" target="_blank">Anusha Shankar</a>.
