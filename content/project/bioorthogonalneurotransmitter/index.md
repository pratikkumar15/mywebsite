Substituted cyclopropenes serve as compact biorthogonal appendages that enable analysis of biomolecules in complex systems. Neurotransmitters, a chemically diverse group of biomolecules that control neuron excitation and inhibition, are not among the systems that have been studied using biorthogonal chemistry. Here we describe:
<p></p><b>1.</b> Synthesis of cyclopropene-containing analogs of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate
<p></p><b>2.</b> Synthesis of a photoactivatable version of cyclopropene-glutamate
<p></p><b>3.</b> Bioorthogonal reaction of such cyclopropene-glutamates with tetrazines and tetrazoles <br></br>

This strategy has the potential to permit deployment of cyclopropene-modified glutamate as a bioorthogonal probe of the neurotransmitter glutamate <i>in vivo</i> with spatiotemporal precision.
