Cyclic enamines are important synthons for many synthetic and pharmacological targets. Here, we report an inexpensive, catalyst-free, multigram-scale synthesis for cyclic enamines with exocyclic double bonds and four- to seven-membered rings. This strategy is more conducive to scale up, permissive of functionalization around the cyclic system, and less sensitive to the nature of the N-protecting group than previously-described methods for cyclic enamine synthesis. Further, we explore application of these enamines to the synthesis of highly-strained spirocyclic 3N-cyclopropyl scaffolds.

Lipidated cyclopropenes serve as useful bioorthogonal reagents for imaging cell membranes due to the cyclopropene's small size and ability to ligate with pro-fluorescent tetrazines. Previously, the lipidation of cyclopropenes required modification at the C3 position because methods to append lipids at C1/C2 were not available. Herein, we describe C1/C2 lipidation with the biologically active lipid ceramide and a common phospholipid using a cyclopropene scaffold whose reactivity with 1,2,4,5-tetrazines has been caged.
