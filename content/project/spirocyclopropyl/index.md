Inexpensive, catalyst-free, multigram-scale synthesis for cyclic enamines with exocyclic double bonds and four- to seven-membered rings. This strategy is more conducive to scale up, permissive of functionalization around the cyclic system, and less sensitive to the nature of the N-protecting group than previously-described methods for cyclic enamine synthesis. Further, we explore application of these enamines to the synthesis of highly-strained spirocyclic 3N-cyclopropyl scaffolds. These spirocyclic systems were lipidated to serve as useful bioorthogonal reagents for imaging cell membranes due to the cyclopropene's small size and ability to ligate with pro-fluorescent tetrazines.
